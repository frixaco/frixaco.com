title: "My thoughts on Astro that no one asked"

## TLDR:

This website is made with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and it's my first time using Astro. Here is my genuine impression with Astro so far:

<br />

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
	<img src="../../../public/noway.gif" width="364" height="225" alt="noway" />
</div>

<br />
<br />

Honestly, I feel like if they go a little bit more in the direction of supporting dynamic and highly interactive websites, it's going to be f@!king awesome and I would immediately switch to it. Although, with integration support for React, Solid, Vue, Svelte, etc. it almost feels like there is no need for that. But I would love to see Astro's take on dynamic & highly interactive websites.

<br />

These are just my initial thoughts after playing around with Astro for a few days and making a single website with a little bit of interactivity. I will 100% be trying it out in future projects, especially for one with more interactivity and see how it's like to works with Astro's [Islands](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/) architecture.
