title: "My thoughts on Astro that no one asked"

## TLDR:

I've build this website with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and it's my first time using it. Here is my genuine, honest reaction to Astro so far:

<br />

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
	<img src="/noway.gif" width="364" height="225" alt="noway" />
</div>

<br />
<br />

Although, with their integration support for React, Solid, Vue, Svelte, etc. it almost feels like there is no need for them to come up with their solution for dynamic & highly interactive apps, I still would love to see Astro's take on them.

<br />

These are just my initial thoughts after playing around with Astro for a few days and putting together a single website with a little bit of interactivity. Next, I plan to explore Astro's [Islands](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/) architecture...
