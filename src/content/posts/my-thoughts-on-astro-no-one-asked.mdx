title: "My thoughts on Astro that no one asked"

## TLDR:

I've build this website with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and it's my first time using it. Here is my genuine, honest take on Astro so far:

<br />

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
	<img src="/noway.gif" width="364" height="225" alt="noway" />
</div>

<br />
<br />

Honestly, if they push a bit further towards supporting dynamic and highly interactive websites, it would be f@!king awesome and I'd switch over in a heartbeat. Although, with their integration support for React, Solid, Vue, Svelte, etc. it almost feels like there is no need for it. Still, I would love to see Astro's take on dynamic & highly interactive websites.

<br />

These are just my initial thoughts after playing around with Astro for a few days and putting together a single website with a little bit of interactivity. I will 100% be trying it out in future projects, especially for ones with more interactivity and properly explore Astro's [Islands](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/) architecture.
