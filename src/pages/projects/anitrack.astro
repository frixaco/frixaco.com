						the biggest challenge was figuring out torrent streaming. i first tried <a
							target="_blank"
							class="underline"
							href="https://github.com/webtorrent/webtorrent">webtorrent</a
						> for in-browser streaming, but browser limitations and the library itself were a pain to deal with. then decided
						to stream the torrent from a server to frontend instead. tested
						<a class="underline" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/anacrolix/torrent"
							>anacrolix's torrent client in Go</a
						>, but ran into memory leaks (skill issue) and it didn't support streaming without downloading first.
						finally, i discovered **amazing** <a
							target="_blank"
							class="underline"
							href="https://github.com/ikatson/rqbit">rqbit</a
						>, a Rust torrent client that was exactly what i needed - it could download and stream videos
						simultaneously, run as a server, had all the necessary api endpoints, and even came with a ui for torrent
						management. plus, it had a ready-to-use Docker Compose file, so I just rented a VPS and deployed it there.
					</li>

					<li>
						for the rest of the project, i went with Next.js. though i started with a separate backend and frontend (you
						can see it in the commit history), i took a break and came back with better idea. decided to do a complete
						rewrite using Next.js with Server Actions and hosted it for free on vercel.com. this part was pretty
						straightforward.
					</li>
				</ul>

			<li>
				everything else except the above part was made in Next.js. if you look at commit history, you'll see initially i
				had a separate backend. after a short break i came back and decided to do full rewrite and used Next.js with
				Server Actions and deploy it on <a target="_blank" class="underline" href="https://vercel.com">vercel.com</a> for
				free. easy peasy.
