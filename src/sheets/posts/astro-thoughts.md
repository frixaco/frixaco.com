# My thoughts on Astro that no one asked

## TLDR:

I've build v1 and v2 versions of this website with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and it was my first time using it. Here is my genuine, honest reaction to Astro so far:

Although, with their integration support for React, Solid, Vue, Svelte, etc. it almost feels like there is no need for them to come up with their solution for dynamic & highly interactive apps, I still would love to see Astro's take on them.

These are just my initial thoughts after playing around with Astro for a few days and putting together a single website with a little bit of interactivity. Next, I plan to explore Astro's [Islands](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/) architecture.
